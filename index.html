                        provide a great creative environment for you to express your ideas. The services I provide allow
                        you to bring in a voice memo or idea and I figure out what key your song is in and tailor a
                        custom beat around your initial idea.</p>
                    <p class="grey">I am a trained professional musician and want to bring your ideas to life. If you

                        site. I’m looking forward to hearing your ideas. </p>
                    <p class="grey">To get the best idea for where your song needs to go we will break down the ideas
                        that you already have. From there we will do sound design and find a good key that fits the vibe
                        of your song. Finally we will track vocals and do a final mix. This is an overview of how a
                        typical session would go.</p>

                                    <li class="grey">1) Print your tracks without any reverb. Avoid inline
                                        processing like compression and EQ as much as possible. Remember to turn off
                                        reverb and
                                        delay effects on VST instruments before printing them.</li>
                                    <li class="grey">2) Consolidate all your tracks. Bounce them all from the same
                                        point within your session.</li>
                                    <li class="grey">3) Do all of your editing including vocal comps, copying
                                        choruses, auto-tuning, etc.</li>
                                    <li class="grey">4) Preferred format is WAV or Broadcast WAV, 24bits, 44.1kHz.
                                        If you tracked your song at only 16 bits, then keep it at 16 bits – do not try
                                        to convert
                                        the file. WAV files are higher quality than MP3 and allows for a cleaner more
                                        accurate mix.
                                    </li>
                                    <li class="grey">5) Please properly label tracks. Such as “piano”, “Synth1”,
                                        “Snare”, “Vox 1”. This will help save time.

                                        for the engineer and/or producer Also anything else such as what was used to

                            He’s very patient but still pushes in a constructive manner to help my son improve.
                            He teaches in a way that anyone of any age could learn from. He’s so nice and polite
                            and has become more than just a teacher to us.
                            He’s someone my son looks up to and we consider ourselves very lucky to have Justin as his
                            teacher.
                            Keeping a 12 year old interested in lessons done virtually isn’t an easy task and Justin has
